# Lambda Default Handler

Hello, this repository contains default handler pre-built for lambda functions in order to speed up the development proccess.

Currently we have:
- Default Handler For Event Bridge

All the handler are integrated with the notification service (https://github.com/PePires58/Notification_nuget) helping us to improve the speed of the application without throwing exceptions when it's not needed.

Also, the methods has logs and abstract methods to be implemented in the main lambda.

Thanks a lot
